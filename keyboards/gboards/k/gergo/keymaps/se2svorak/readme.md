# Gergo se2svorak layout by cttsrk@gmail.com, rev.63

This is a modified Swedish dvorak ("svorak") layout intended for connecting
to PC systems configured with a regular Swedish or Finnish layout, or MacOS
systems with the equivalent "Pro" layout. Switching between PC and MAC mode
persists across power off.

The layout attempts to be comfortable for programming and typing in English
and Swedish. Some effort has been made to keep symbols accessible and
compatible with their common bigrams. All symbols are on the base layer or
the numsym layer, and none are on the shift modifier. This avoids excessive
modifier-hopping when typing e.g `print!("{:#x?}\n", foo);`.

NOTICE that the layout does not use 10 of the keys (5 per hand) available on
the Gergo, as they are less ergonomic and not needed for this layout paradigm.
